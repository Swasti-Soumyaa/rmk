        <p>Every child’s learning curve is identified and appropriate techniques are applied to bring out the best in
            every child. Student centric learning is focused on the student’s needs, abilities, interests, and learning
            styles with the teacher as a facilitator of learning. It helps them to be active and responsible
            participants in their own learning.Our teachers are well trained and experienced in international teaching
            standards. They use innovative teaching methodologies, supported by state-of-the-art facilities and modern
            technology, to arouse the intellectual curiosity of a child.

            Our teachers take the advanced role of “facilitators” to help children explore and discover life through
            learning.

        <p>RMK Patashaala – The name itself means that it is a centre for learning and not just a ‘school’. The
            institution is yet another milestone in the RMK Group’s endeavour to deliver the highest standards in
            education in the country. Following the CBSE stream, RMK Patashaala will be a centre for learning of life.

            The best part of a child’s growing phase is spent in the school and in the present times, a school should go
            beyond just ‘teaching’ and inspire a child to learn beyond the “Syllabus” and understand life. RMK
            Patashaala that way, is a unique school that will create a ‘learner’ in each child who will automatically
            become leaders in their chosen arena. We believe that such an ideal is possible to achieve, and we have
            testimony of having created so many thought-leaders, professionals, and successful graduates who are making
            a strong impact in the world.</p>
